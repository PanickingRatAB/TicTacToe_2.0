A 9x9 Tic Tac Toe grid to play against friends.

How to Play

Player one chooses any of the small boards that they want to and plays anywhere on that board.
On player twoâ€™s turn, they don't have the freedom to go anywhere that they want to.
Wherever the last mark was played locally, that is where the next person needs to play globally.
When someone does get three in a row on a small board, they can put a big X or a big O through the whole thing.
And then the first person that is able to get three in a row on the large board wins.
